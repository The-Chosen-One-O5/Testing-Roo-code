# Forest Guardian Platformer - Development Implementation Guide

## Development Setup and Best Practices

### Initial Project Setup
1. **Project Structure Creation**
   ```
   forest-guardian-platformer/
   ├── index.html
   ├── css/style.css
   ├── js/
   │   ├── main.js
   │   ├── config.js
   │   └── [system folders]
   └── assets/
       ├── sprites/
       ├── audio/
       └── maps/
   ```

2. **Phaser.js Integration**
   - Use Phaser 3.70+ for latest features
   - CDN link: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.70.0/dist/phaser.min.js`
   - Configure game with 800x600 resolution, scaled to fit screen

### Core System Implementation Details

## 1. Player Character System

### Movement Controller Implementation
```javascript
// Key features to implement:
- WASD/Arrow key input handling
- Variable jump height (50-150px based on hold duration)
- Horizontal movement with acceleration/deceleration
- Coyote time (100ms grace period after leaving platform)
- Jump buffering (100ms input window before landing)
```

### Animation States
- **Idle**: 4-frame loop, 8 FPS
- **Walk**: 6-frame cycle, 12 FPS
- **Jump**: 3-frame sequence (takeoff, air, land)
- **Dash**: 2-frame quick animation, 20 FPS

### Ability System Progression
- **Base Movement**: Walk, jump (unlocked from start)
- **Double Jump**: Unlocked at 5 gems collected
- **Dash Move**: Unlocked at 10 gems collected
- **Wall Slide**: Potential future ability at 15 gems

## 2. Physics and Collision System

### Collision Layers
```javascript
// Collision categories:
PLAYER = 1
ENEMIES = 2
PLATFORMS = 4
COLLECTIBLES = 8
PROJECTILES = 16
TRIGGERS = 32
```

### Physics Parameters
- **Gravity**: 800 pixels/second²
- **Player Speed**: 200 pixels/second horizontal
- **Jump Force**: -400 pixels/second initial velocity
- **Dash Speed**: 400 pixels/second for 200ms duration

## 3. Enemy AI Implementation

### Woodland Sprite (Flying Enemy)
```javascript
// Behavior Pattern:
- Sine wave flight pattern
- 150px detection radius
- Gentle pursuit when player detected
- 30 HP, deals 1 damage on contact
```

### Root Crawler (Ground Enemy)
```javascript
// Behavior Pattern:
- Platform-bound patrol movement
- 100px detection radius
- Direct ground pursuit of player
- 50 HP, deals 2 damage on contact
```

### Thorn Beast (Aggressive Enemy)
```javascript
// Behavior Pattern:
- Charge attack when player within 200px
- 3-second cooldown between charges
- Stuns briefly after hitting walls
- 80 HP, deals 3 damage on contact
```

## 4. Level Design Guidelines

### Mystical Forest Biome Layout
```
Tutorial Section (0-200px):
- Basic movement introduction
- Simple platforms and gaps
- First gem collection tutorial

Early Challenges (200-800px):
- Introduction of first enemy type
- Moving platforms
- Double jump unlock area

Mid-Level Content (800-1400px):
- Multiple enemy types
- Environmental puzzles
- Dash ability unlock

Advanced Section (1400-2000px):
- Complex platforming sequences
- All enemy types combined
- Pre-boss challenge area

Boss Arena (2000-2200px):
- Large open area for boss fight
- Multiple platform levels
- Environmental hazards
```

### Platform Design Principles
- **Minimum Gap**: 120px (achievable with basic jump)
- **Double Jump Gap**: 200px (requires double jump)
- **Dash Gap**: 300px (requires dash ability)
- **Platform Width**: Minimum 64px for comfortable landing

## 5. Asset Integration Strategy

### Recommended Free Asset Sources
1. **OpenGameArt.org**
   - Search terms: "forest", "platformer", "pixel art"
   - Look for 16x16 or 32x32 pixel sprites
   - Ensure consistent art style across assets

2. **Freesound.org**
   - Forest ambience loops
   - Jump/land sound effects
   - Gem collection chimes
   - Enemy defeat sounds

### Asset Optimization
- **Sprite Sheets**: Combine related animations
- **Audio Format**: OGG for web compatibility
- **File Sizes**: Keep individual files under 500KB
- **Naming Convention**: descriptive_lowercase_names.ext

## 6. Progressive Difficulty Implementation

### Difficulty Curve Design
```
Difficulty Level 1 (0-25% progress):
- Single enemy types
- Simple platforming
- Clear visual cues

Difficulty Level 2 (25-50% progress):
- Multiple enemy types
- Moving platforms introduced
- Basic environmental puzzles

Difficulty Level 3 (50-75% progress):
- Enemy combinations
- Complex platforming sequences
- Timed challenges

Difficulty Level 4 (75-100% progress):
- All mechanics combined
- Precision platforming required
- Boss battle preparation
```

### Tutorial Integration
- **Show, Don't Tell**: Visual demonstrations over text
- **Gradual Introduction**: One new mechanic per section
- **Safe Practice Areas**: Low-stakes areas to practice new skills
- **Clear Feedback**: Immediate response to player actions

## 7. Boss Battle Design

### Forest Guardian Boss Phases

#### Phase 1: Ground Assault (100-75% HP)
- Charge attacks across arena
- Summons Root Crawler minions
- Vulnerable after charge attacks

#### Phase 2: Aerial Dominance (75-50% HP)
- Takes to the air
- Summons Woodland Sprite minions
- Dive bomb attacks with warning indicators

#### Phase 3: Desperate Fury (50-0% HP)
- Combines ground and air attacks
- Environmental hazards activated
- Faster attack patterns
- Requires all player abilities to defeat

### Boss Attack Patterns
- **Telegraph System**: 1-second warning before attacks
- **Safe Zones**: Clear areas where player can avoid damage
- **Vulnerability Windows**: 2-3 second openings for player attacks

## 8. Audio Integration Strategy

### Dynamic Audio System
```javascript
// Audio layers:
- Background ambience (forest sounds, wind)
- Background music (mystical forest theme)
- Player action sounds (jump, dash, gem collection)
- Enemy sounds (movement, attacks, defeats)
- Environmental sounds (platform movement, switches)
```

### Audio Triggers
- **Proximity-Based**: Environmental sounds fade in/out
- **Action-Based**: Immediate feedback for player actions
- **State-Based**: Music changes for boss battle
- **Collection-Based**: Special sounds for ability unlocks

## 9. Performance Optimization Guidelines

### Rendering Optimization
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse particle effects and projectiles
- **Culling**: Only update objects within camera bounds + buffer
- **Sprite Batching**: Group similar sprites for efficient rendering
- **Texture Atlases**: Minimize texture swaps

### Memory Management
- **Asset Cleanup**: Remove unused assets between scenes
- **Event Listeners**: Properly remove listeners to prevent leaks
- **Animation Cleanup**: Stop animations for off-screen objects

## 10. Testing and Quality Assurance

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] All controls respond within 100ms
- [ ] No collision detection bugs or glitches
- [ ] Smooth 60 FPS performance on target devices
- [ ] Audio plays correctly and at appropriate volumes
- [ ] Save system preserves progress correctly
- [ ] All abilities unlock at correct gem thresholds
- [ ] Boss battle is challenging but fair
- [ ] Level progression feels natural and engaging

### Browser Compatibility
- **Primary Targets**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+
- **Mobile Support**: Touch controls for mobile devices
- **Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation for older browsers
