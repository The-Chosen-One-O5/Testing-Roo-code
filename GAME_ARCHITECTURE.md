# Forest Guardian Platformer - Technical Architecture

## Project Overview
A 2D side-scrolling platformer demo featuring a forest guardian character navigating through a mystical forest biome. Built with HTML5/JavaScript and Phaser.js for web deployment.

## Technology Stack
- **Game Engine**: Phaser.js 3.x
- **Language**: JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Platform**: Web (HTML5 Canvas)
- **Assets**: Free/open-source pixel art and audio
- **Development Tools**: VS Code, browser dev tools

## System Architecture

### Core Game Systems

#### 1. Scene Management System
```
GameScene (main gameplay)
├── PreloadScene (asset loading)
├── MenuScene (main menu)
├── GameOverScene (game over screen)
└── VictoryScene (level completion)
```

#### 2. Player Character System
- **Movement Controller**: Handles input, physics, and state management
- **Animation Manager**: Sprite animations (idle, walk, jump, dash)
- **Ability System**: Unlockable abilities (double jump, dash)
- **State Machine**: Player states (grounded, jumping, dashing, etc.)

#### 3. Level System
- **Tilemap Renderer**: Phaser tilemap system for level geometry
- **Parallax Background**: Multi-layer scrolling backgrounds
- **Moving Platforms**: Physics-based moving platform system
- **Environmental Puzzles**: Interactive objects (switches, doors)

#### 4. Enemy AI System
- **Base Enemy Class**: Common behavior patterns
- **Forest Enemies**: Biome-specific creatures
  - Woodland Sprites (flying patrol)
  - Root Crawlers (ground patrol)
  - Thorn Beasts (aggressive chase)

#### 5. Collectibles & Progression
- **Gem Collection**: Pickup system with visual/audio feedback
- **Ability Unlocks**: Progressive ability acquisition
- **Checkpoint System**: Save progress at designated points

#### 6. Boss Battle System
- **Forest Guardian Boss**: Multi-phase encounter
- **Attack Patterns**: Varied attack sequences
- **Health System**: Both player and boss health management

## Technical Implementation Details

### Physics System
- **Phaser Arcade Physics**: Lightweight 2D physics
- **Custom Jump Mechanics**: Variable height based on input duration
- **Collision Layers**: Separate collision groups for different object types

### Asset Management
- **Sprite Atlases**: Optimized sprite sheets for animations
- **Audio Manager**: Background music and sound effect system
- **Resource Loading**: Efficient asset preloading and caching

### Performance Optimization
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse game objects (bullets, particles, enemies)
- **Culling**: Only render objects within camera view
- **Asset Compression**: Optimized sprite and audio files

## Key Features Implementation

### 1. Responsive Jump Mechanics
- Track jump button press duration
- Apply variable force based on hold time
- Implement coyote time for forgiving platforming
- Add jump buffering for responsive controls

### 2. Parallax Scrolling
- Multiple background layers moving at different speeds
- Camera-relative positioning for depth effect
- Seamless looping for infinite backgrounds

### 3. Ability System
- Gem-based progression unlocking new abilities
- Double jump: Second jump available after unlock
- Dash move: Horizontal burst movement with cooldown

### 4. Environmental Puzzles
- Pressure plate switches
- Moving platforms triggered by switches
- Collectible-gated doors and passages

### 5. Progressive Difficulty
- Tutorial area introducing basic mechanics
- Gradual introduction of new enemy types
- Increasing platform complexity and puzzle difficulty

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Project setup and basic Phaser.js integration
- Player character with basic movement and jumping
- Simple level with collision detection

### Phase 2: Core Mechanics (Week 3-4)
- Advanced movement (variable jump, abilities)
- Enemy AI and basic combat
- Collectible and progression systems

### Phase 3: Content & Polish (Week 5-6)
- Complete mystical forest level design
- Boss battle implementation
- Audio integration and visual effects

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Week 7-8)

- Web deployment preparation

## Asset Requirements

### Visual Assets
- Player character sprite sheet (8 directions, 4-6 frames each)
- Enemy sprites (3 types, animated)
- Boss sprite sheet (multiple attack animations)
- Tileset for forest environment
- Parallax background layers (3-4 layers)
- UI elements (health bar, gem counter, ability icons)
- Particle effects (gem sparkles, jump dust, etc.)

### Audio Assets
- Background music (mystical forest theme)
- Sound effects:
  - Jump, land, dash sounds
  - Gem collection chime
  - Enemy defeat sounds
  - Boss battle music and effects
  - Environmental sounds (switches, doors)

## Success Metrics
